I love their simple design, with a layout that is easy to maneuver. They also use a strong but limited color pallete. The site is also optimized well and loads what seems like instantly.

I enjoy their use of white space (empty space) as well as their use of transitions from image to image as you scroll down the page, very dynamic and fun. Background colors are a bit strong, would suggest choosing more pleasing colors to look at.

Their creative use of a high quality background video, as well as a very simple, minimal UI experience is a nice experience. The menu, however, is kind of buggy. The "What We Do" section wouldn't let me click it for a bit, but eventually worked, as well as the "Play Our Reel" button would work and not work at times.

I think bose does a good job at many of the elements I stated above, except for having a video. The website is easy to navigate, has muted colors, as well as high quality images showing off their products. One thing I dislike is how cluttered their menu navigation looks. The heirarchy is there, but the assymetry of navigation on the right but none on the left doesn't look that good to me. The dropdown menus look fine however.

Fun design with colors and animations that pop and demand your attention. Easy to navigate, and an overall good user experience. One thing is I wish they would speed up their menu transition, as well as fixing the scrolling as it was a bit janky and would freeze at times.
