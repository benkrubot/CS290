/* Not sure if the marbles are supposed to be indivdual things. If so, then I will change my code to reflect that
such as creating a list or array called bag that will add the number of marbles to it via user input. So if I had
an empty bag of marbles and the user wanted to add 5 marbles, maybe it would look something like:
{0, 0, 0, 0, 0} indicating there are 5 marbles in the bag now. */
